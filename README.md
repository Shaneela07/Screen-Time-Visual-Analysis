# 📊 Screen Time Visual Analysis

An interactive **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and insights project** focused on understanding and visualizing screen time usage patterns using **Plotly**.  
This project explores how time spent on devices varies across different applications, notifications, and usage trends — revealing key behavioral patterns through rich, interactive visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project dives deep into screen time data to uncover meaningful insights about device usage behavior.  
Through visual analysis with Plotly, we aim to answer questions like:

- 📱 How is screen time distributed across different apps or categories?  
- ⏰ What times of the day see the highest usage?  
- 🔔 How do notifications influence screen activity?  
- 📈 What patterns emerge from daily or weekly usage trends?

With a clean and visually compelling analysis, this project aims to highlight the power of data visualization in understanding **digital habits** and **user behavior**. The insights generated can help users, developers, and product teams make more informed decisions around **digital well-being**, **app engagement**, and **time management**.
